Subject: Demo Request - Honours Student

Dear [MODEL NAME] team,

My name is Jason and I'm writing to request a demo of your product. 

I'm writing my law honours thesis at Sydney University at the moment and I'm investigating LLMs and their capability to do the work of lawyers. I was interested as part of my research in having a look at [MODEL NAME]'s capability and how I might be able to use it in some of my research.

My research centres around the increasing use of AI in litigation and arbitration. I will be using the problem question from the Willem C. Vis Moot from last year, and asking selected AI tools to generate written submissions or parts of written submissions, grading them, and considering the implications for the legal profession. Of course I'm very happy to make the results available to you.

Keen to hear from you.

Best,

Jason
