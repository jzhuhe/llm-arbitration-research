Hello! Thank you so much for helping me with my research.

For context, I am looking at whether LLMs can generate submissions on par with top law students in an arbitration context. 

Attached are 6 claimant submissions (C_A.pdf, C_B.pdf etc), and 5 respondent submissions (R_A.pdf, R_B.pdf). They have been anonymised. 

Some will be AI generated. Some will be winning submissions from last year. Please do the following:
    1.	Rank the claimant submissions from 1-7 and respondents 1-5, with 1 being the best. This should be solely based on how they read, how convincing and logical the arguments are. Don’t have any regard to accuracy of sources (unless blatantly wrong/unconvincing, because I’m checking every single source manually).
    2.	If you have desire/time, label which you think are AI generated and which are written by students.
    3.	Also if you desire/have time, feel free to give examples or comments of things that stood out to you - for instance giveaways that it was AI generated, or student generated.

Thank you so much again!
