## Reponse

**Summary of Facts**

In 2023, a cyberattack targeted the law firm representing the Claimant, compromising sensitive communications and payment instructions related to Purchase Order No. 9601. Unaware of the breach, the Respondent received altered payment details and subsequently transferred funds to a fraudulent account. The Claimant, not receiving the expected payment, initiated arbitration, alleging non-payment and breach of contract. The Respondent contends that the payment was executed as per the instructions provided and asserts that the Claimant's inadequate cybersecurity measures led to the misdirection of funds. The dispute centers on the allocation of liability for the financial loss resulting from the cyber fraud.

# Prompt 3

## Response

**Summary of Argument**

**I. The Tribunal Should Not Authorize the Addition of the New Claim**

1. **Jurisdictional Overreach**: The proposed additional claim exceeds the scope defined in the original Terms of Reference, lacking a direct connection to the existing dispute. Per Article 23(4) of the ICC Rules, introducing new claims at this stage requires careful consideration of their relevance and timing. citeturn0search3

2. **Procedural Prejudice**: Allowing the new claim would unduly prejudice the Respondent by introducing unrelated issues, leading to increased complexity, potential delays, and higher costs, thereby undermining procedural fairness.

**II. The Tribunal Should Not Consolidate the Proceedings**

1. **Lack of Jurisdiction for Consolidation**: The authority to consolidate arbitrations under Article 10 of the ICC Rules is vested exclusively in the ICC Court, not the arbitral tribunal. The parties have not mutually agreed to modify this provision, rendering any tribunal-led consolidation beyond its jurisdiction. citeturn0search3

2. **Incompatibility of Arbitration Agreements**: The claims arise from separate contracts with distinct arbitration clauses. Consolidation is inappropriate as the arbitration agreements are not compatible, and the disputes do not share sufficient legal and factual commonality. citeturn0search1

3. **Prejudice to Respondent**: Consolidation would lead to procedural complications, increased costs, and potential delays, adversely affecting the Respondent's ability to present its case effectively.

**III. Claimant Is Not Entitled to Payment Under Purchase Order No. 9601**

1. **Fulfillment of Payment Obligation**: The Respondent executed the payment in accordance with the instructions received, which were believed to be legitimate. The non-receipt of funds by the Claimant resulted from a cyber fraud incident, not from any fault or breach by the Respondent.

2. **Allocation of Risk**: The Claimant's inadequate cybersecurity measures led to the interception and alteration of payment instructions. As such, the risk of loss due to cyber fraud should be borne by the party whose negligence facilitated the fraud, in this case, the Claimant. citeturn0search2

**IV. Claimant Cannot Invoke a Violation of Contractual Duty or the CISG to Avoid Payment Obligations**

1. **Absence of Duty of Disclosure**: Neither the contract nor the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) imposes a duty on the Respondent to disclose information regarding the cyberattack, especially when the Respondent was unaware of the breach.

2. **Inapplicability of Article 80 CISG**: The Claimant's failure to implement adequate cybersecurity measures constitutes negligence contributing to its loss. Under Article 80 of the CISG, a party cannot rely on the other party's non-performance if it resulted from the first party's own actions or omissions.

3. **Mitigation of Damages**: Article 77 of the CISG requires a party to mitigate losses. The Claimant failed to take reasonable steps to secure its communications, thereby failing to mitigate the risk of fraud. Consequently, the Claimant cannot shift the burden of its own negligence onto the Respondent.

**Conclusion**

The Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal dismiss the additional claim, deny the consolidation of proceedings, declare that the Respondent has fulfilled its payment obligations under Purchase Order No. 9601, and reject the Claimant's allegations of contractual or CISG violations.

## Response

**II. ISSUE A: THE TRIBUNAL CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT AUTHORIZE THE ADDITION OF THE NEW CLAIM**

1. **The Additional Claim Falls Outside the Limits of the Terms of Reference**

   1.1. **No Sufficient Connection Between the Additional Claim and the Existing Claim**

    The Terms of Reference (ToR) in ICC arbitration serve to delineate the scope of the arbitration by summarizing the parties' claims and the relief sought, thereby establishing the framework within which the tribunal operates.   The additional claim introduced by the Claimant pertains to a separate transaction under Purchase Order No. A-15604, which is distinct from the original dispute concerning Purchase Order No. 9601.   This lack of a direct factual or legal nexus between the two claims indicates that the new claim falls outside the established ToR.   As such, introducing this claim would expand the scope of the arbitration beyond its original mandate, contravening the purpose of the ToR to provide clarity and structure to the proceedings.  

   1.2. **The Terms of Reference Exhaustively Define the Issues to be Determined**

    The ToR are intended to comprehensively outline the issues to be resolved in the arbitration, as stipulated in Article 23(1) of the ICC Rules.   Once the ToR are signed, they set definitive boundaries for the arbitration, ensuring that all parties have a mutual understanding of the matters under consideration.   The introduction of new claims that were not contemplated in the original ToR undermines this foundational principle.   The Claimant's attempt to add a new claim after the ToR have been established disregards the agreed-upon procedural framework and disrupts the arbitration's orderly progression.  

2. **The Tribunal Lacks Authority to Authorize the Additional Claim under ICC Rules**

   2.1. **Article 23(4) ICC Rules Cannot Override the Parties’ Agreement**

    Article 23(4) of the ICC Rules provides that after the ToR have been signed, no party may make new claims falling outside their scope unless authorized by the tribunal.   However, this provision does not grant the tribunal unfettered discretion to accept new claims, especially when such claims contravene the parties' original agreement as encapsulated in the ToR.   The tribunal's primary duty is to uphold the parties' procedural agreements to maintain the integrity of the arbitration process.   Authorizing a new claim that extends beyond the agreed-upon scope would violate this duty and potentially lead to questions about the enforceability of the tribunal's decisions.  

   2.2. **Authorization Would Unduly Prejudice Respondent**

    Allowing the additional claim at this stage would impose undue prejudice on the Respondent.   The introduction of a new, unrelated claim would necessitate additional preparation, potentially involving new evidence and legal arguments, thereby increasing the complexity, duration, and cost of the proceedings.   This scenario contradicts the principles of procedural efficiency and fairness that underpin the ICC Rules.   Moreover, the Respondent has a legitimate expectation that the arbitration will address only those issues outlined in the ToR, and expanding the scope at this juncture would undermine that expectation.  

3. **The Additional Claim Lacks Procedural Justification**

   3.1. **Unreasonable Delay in Bringing the Additional Claim**

    The Claimant's delay in introducing the new claim is procedurally unjustifiable.   The facts underlying the additional claim were known or should have been known to the Claimant well before the ToR were finalized.   Failing to include this claim in the initial proceedings suggests a lack of diligence and raises concerns about potential tactical maneuvering.   Arbitral tribunals are generally reluctant to permit amendments that could disrupt the proceedings, especially when the requesting party cannot provide a compelling justification for the delay.  

   3.2. **Authorization Would Undermine Procedural Fairness and Efficiency**

    Introducing a new claim at this stage would compromise the procedural fairness and efficiency of the arbitration.   It would likely necessitate revisiting procedural orders, extending deadlines, and possibly reopening phases of the arbitration that were considered settled.   Such disruptions not only prolong the resolution of the dispute but also increase costs for both parties.   The ICC Rules emphasize the importance of conducting arbitrations in an expeditious and cost-effective manner, and allowing the additional claim would be antithetical to these objectives.  

**Conclusion**

In light of the above arguments, the Tribunal should decline to authorize the addition of the new claim. The claim falls outside the scope of the established Terms of Reference, the Tribunal lacks the authority to override the parties' procedural agreement, and permitting the claim would unduly prejudice the Respondent while undermining the principles of procedural fairness and efficiency.

## Response

**III. ISSUE B: THE TRIBUNAL CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT CONSOLIDATE THE PROCEEDINGS**

1. **The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction to Consolidate Under ICC Rules**

   1.1. **Article 10 ICC Rules Vests Power of Consolidation Exclusively in the ICC Court**

   Article 10 of the ICC Arbitration Rules explicitly grants the International Court of Arbitration (the "ICC Court") the exclusive authority to consolidate arbitrations. The provision states: "The Court may, at the request of a party, consolidate two or more arbitrations pending under the Rules into a single arbitration..." citeturn0search1. The use of the term "The Court" refers specifically to the ICC Court, as defined in Article 1(2) of the ICC Rules, which outlines the functions of the ICC Court, including the administration of arbitrations and decisions on consolidation.

   The ICC Court's exclusive power to consolidate is further reinforced by the administrative nature of such decisions, which are intended to ensure the efficient and fair conduct of proceedings. This structure prevents arbitral tribunals from unilaterally altering the scope of their jurisdiction or the composition of the arbitration without the oversight of the ICC Court. Therefore, any attempt by the Tribunal to consolidate proceedings without the ICC Court's authorization would exceed its jurisdiction and contravene the established procedural framework of the ICC Rules.

   1.2. **The Parties Did Not Effectively Modify Article 10 ICC Rules**

   While parties to an arbitration agreement have the autonomy to modify certain procedural aspects, any alteration of the ICC Rules, particularly concerning consolidation, must be explicit and mutually agreed upon. In the present case, there is no evidence that the parties have agreed to deviate from the standard provisions of Article 10. The arbitration agreements in question do not contain any clauses that confer consolidation authority upon the Tribunal or modify the role of the ICC Court in this regard. Absent a clear and unequivocal agreement between the parties to alter the consolidation mechanism, the default provisions of the ICC Rules prevail, thereby reserving the power of consolidation exclusively to the ICC Court.

2. **The Conditions for Consolidation Are Not Satisfied**

   2.1. **The Claims Do Not Share Sufficient Legal and Factual Commonality**

   For consolidation to be appropriate under Article 10 of the ICC Rules, the claims must exhibit a significant degree of legal and factual commonality. This requirement ensures that the consolidated proceedings are coherent and that the disputes are sufficiently interconnected to warrant a joint resolution. In the current scenario, the claims arise from separate contracts—Purchase Order No. 9601 and Purchase Order No. A-15604—each with distinct terms, obligations, and factual backgrounds. The mere fact that both claims involve the same parties does not suffice to establish the necessary connection; the disputes pertain to different transactions and are based on separate contractual frameworks. Consolidating such disparate claims would complicate the proceedings and could lead to confusion, thereby undermining the efficiency and effectiveness of the arbitration process.

   2.2. **The Arbitration Agreements Are Not Compatible**

   Article 10(c) of the ICC Rules permits consolidation when "the claims in the arbitrations are not made under the same arbitration agreement or agreements, but the arbitrations are between the same parties, the disputes in the arbitrations arise in connection with the same legal relationship, and the Court finds the arbitration agreements to be compatible." citeturn0search1. In this context, compatibility of arbitration agreements is assessed based on factors such as the seat of arbitration, the number of arbitrators, the language of the proceedings, and the substantive law governing the contracts. In the present case, the arbitration agreements under Purchase Order No. 9601 and Purchase Order No. A-15604 differ in several material aspects, including [specify differences, e.g., governing law, arbitration seat, etc.]. These discrepancies render the arbitration agreements incompatible, thereby failing to meet the criteria for consolidation under Article 10(c).

3. **Consolidation Would Prejudice Respondent**

   3.1. **Delay and Procedural Disruption**

   Consolidating the proceedings at this stage would likely cause significant delays and procedural disruptions. Each claim is at a different procedural juncture, and merging them would necessitate aligning schedules, potentially reopening phases of the arbitration that have already been completed, and addressing the complexities arising from the differing contractual contexts. Such disruptions would not only prolong the resolution of the disputes but also undermine the procedural efficiency that arbitration seeks to provide. The Respondent has a legitimate interest in the prompt and orderly resolution of each dispute as per the agreed-upon procedures, and consolidation would unjustly impede this interest.

   3.2. **Increased Costs and Complexity**

   The introduction of a consolidated proceeding would inherently increase the complexity of the arbitration. The Tribunal would be required to navigate and adjudicate issues arising from two distinct contracts, each with its own factual matrix and legal considerations. This added complexity would likely lead to increased legal fees, administrative costs, and a more protracted timeline for resolution. Such an outcome would be prejudicial to the Respondent, who is entitled to a cost-effective and efficient arbitration process as initially contemplated in the separate arbitration agreements.

**Conclusion**

In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to consolidate the proceedings, as the authority to do so resides exclusively with the ICC Court under Article 10 of the ICC Rules. Furthermore, the necessary conditions for consolidation are not met, given the lack of sufficient legal and factual commonality between the claims and the incompatibility of the arbitration agreements. Additionally, consolidation would result in undue prejudice to the Respondent through delays, procedural disruptions, and increased costs. Therefore, the Tribunal should decline to consolidate the proceedings.

## Responses

**IV. ISSUE C: CLAIMANT IS NOT ENTITLED TO PAYMENT UNDER PURCHASE ORDER NO. 9601**

1. **Respondent Has Fulfilled Its Payment Obligation**

   1.1. **Payment Was Made in Accordance With the Instructions Received**

   The Respondent executed the payment as per the instructions provided, which were believed to be legitimate at the time of the transaction. The payment details, including the bank account information, were received through what appeared to be the Claimant's official communication channels. In the absence of any apparent irregularities or warnings, the Respondent had no reason to suspect that the instructions were fraudulent. Therefore, the Respondent acted in good faith, adhering to the agreed-upon payment terms under Purchase Order No. 9601.

   1.2. **Claimant’s Internal Lapses and Cybersecurity Failures Caused Non-Receipt**

   The non-receipt of funds by the Claimant resulted from a compromise within the Claimant's internal communication systems. A third party gained unauthorized access to the Claimant's email accounts, altering payment instructions without the knowledge of either party. This security breach within the Claimant's domain directly led to the misdirection of funds. Given that the Respondent followed the instructions received in good faith, the loss incurred is attributable to the Claimant's failure to maintain robust cybersecurity measures.

2. **Claimant Cannot Shift the Risk of Cyber Fraud to Respondent**

   2.1. **Claimant Failed to Exercise Reasonable Cybersecurity Due Diligence**

   In the realm of international commercial transactions, both parties are expected to implement and maintain adequate cybersecurity protocols to protect sensitive information. The Claimant's negligence in safeguarding its communication channels facilitated the unauthorized interception and alteration of payment instructions. This lapse not only contravenes general principles of due diligence but also undermines the trust inherent in contractual relationships. As such, the Claimant bears responsibility for the financial loss resulting from its inadequate cybersecurity measures.

   2.2. **Respondent Relied on Claimant’s Representations in Good Faith**

   The Respondent, upon receiving payment instructions, had a reasonable expectation that such directives were accurate and authorized. Operating under this assumption, the Respondent processed the payment accordingly. The principle of good faith, as enshrined in international commercial law, supports the notion that a party should be able to rely on the representations made by its counterpart. Therefore, the Respondent cannot be held liable for the Claimant's internal security failures that led to the misdirection of funds.

3. **Claimant’s Allegations of Breach Are Unsubstantiated**

   3.1. **The Alleged Failure to Disclose the Cyberattack is Not a Valid Defense**

   The Claimant may argue that the Respondent had an obligation to disclose any knowledge of the cyberattack. However, the Respondent was unaware of the fraudulent activity at the time of payment. Without actual knowledge of the breach, the Respondent could not have disclosed information it did not possess. Moreover, the duty to inform counterparts of internal security incidents primarily rests with the party experiencing the breach—in this case, the Claimant. Thus, the allegation that the Respondent failed to disclose the cyberattack lacks merit.

   3.2. **No Contractual or Legal Duty Required Claimant to Disclose the Cyberattack**

   Even if the Claimant had knowledge of potential vulnerabilities or breaches within its systems, there is no evidence of a contractual or legal obligation mandating the disclosure of such information to the Respondent. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) does not explicitly impose a duty of disclosure regarding internal cybersecurity incidents. In the absence of a specific clause within the contract or a relevant statutory requirement, the Claimant cannot assert a breach based on non-disclosure of the cyberattack.

**Conclusion**

In light of the above, the Respondent has fulfilled its payment obligations under Purchase Order No. 9601 by executing the payment in accordance with the instructions received. The misdirection of funds resulted from the Claimant's inadequate cybersecurity measures, and as such, the Claimant cannot transfer the resultant financial loss to the Respondent. Furthermore, the allegations of breach due to non-disclosure are unsubstantiated, as there was no knowledge of the cyberattack on the part of the Respondent, nor was there a contractual or legal duty requiring such disclosure by the Claimant. Therefore, the Claimant is not entitled to the payment claimed under Purchase Order No. 9601.

## Responses

**V. ISSUE D: CLAIMANT CANNOT INVOKE A VIOLATION OF A CONTRACTUAL DUTY OR THE CISG TO AVOID PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS**

1. **There is No Contractual or Legal Duty of Disclosure Under the CISG**

   1.1. **Article 7(1) CISG Does Not Impose an Independent Duty of Good Faith Disclosure**

   Article 7(1) of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) mandates that, in interpreting the Convention, regard is to be had to its international character and the need to promote uniformity and the observance of good faith in international trade. However, this provision serves as a guideline for the interpretation of the Convention itself and does not impose a direct obligation of good faith or disclosure upon the contracting parties. Scholarly analysis supports this interpretation, indicating that Article 7(1) does not create substantive duties for the parties but rather guides the interpretative approach to the Convention's provisions [Walt, p. 41]. Therefore, the Claimant cannot rely on Article 7(1) to assert a breach of an independent duty of good faith disclosure by the Respondent.

   1.2. **Article 40 FA Requires Written and Signed Amendments to Modify Terms**

   The Framework Agreement (FA) governing the contractual relationship between the parties stipulates in Article 40 that any modifications to its terms must be made in writing and signed by both parties. This clause ensures that any alterations to the contractual obligations are mutually agreed upon and documented, thereby providing certainty and preventing unilateral changes. In the present case, there is no evidence of a written and signed amendment imposing a specific duty of disclosure regarding cybersecurity incidents or payment instruction changes. Absent such an amendment, the Claimant cannot assert that the Respondent had a contractual obligation to disclose information beyond the agreed terms.

2. **Respondent’s Conduct Does Not Trigger Article 80 CISG**

   2.1. **Claimant’s Cybersecurity Negligence Was the True Cause of Non-Performance**

   Article 80 of the CISG provides that a party may not rely on the failure of the other party to perform to the extent that such failure was caused by the first party's act or omission. In this context, the Claimant's inadequate cybersecurity measures led to the interception and alteration of payment instructions, resulting in the misdirection of funds. The Respondent, having acted in accordance with the instructions received, fulfilled its payment obligations under the contract. Therefore, the non-performance—i.e., the Claimant's non-receipt of funds—was directly caused by the Claimant's own negligence in securing its communication channels. As such, the Claimant cannot invoke Article 80 to hold the Respondent liable for the consequences of its own cybersecurity failures.

   2.2. **Claimant Cannot Use Its Own Lapses to Shift Liability Under Article 80 CISG**

   The principle underlying Article 80 is that a party should not benefit from its own wrongdoing or negligence. Allowing the Claimant to shift liability to the Respondent for a breach that resulted from the Claimant's own security lapses would contravene this principle. Legal commentary emphasizes that Article 80 precludes a party from asserting remedies for non-performance when such non-performance is attributable to that party's own actions or omissions [Schwenzer & Manner, p. 719]. In this case, the Claimant's failure to implement adequate cybersecurity protocols was the proximate cause of the misdirected payment, and thus, the Claimant cannot invoke Article 80 to avoid its payment obligations.

3. **Article 77 CISG Does Not Permit a Reduction of Respondent’s Payment Obligation**

   3.1. **Article 77 CISG Applies Only to Mitigation of Damages, Not Payment Obligations**

   Article 77 of the CISG requires that a party relying on a breach of contract take reasonable measures to mitigate the loss resulting from the breach. This provision pertains to the mitigation of damages and does not authorize a reduction or alteration of the fundamental payment obligations stipulated in the contract. In the present dispute, the Respondent has not breached the contract; it executed the payment as per the instructions received. Therefore, Article 77 is inapplicable, as there is no breach by the Respondent that would necessitate mitigation of damages by the Claimant. Consequently, the Claimant cannot invoke Article 77 to justify a reduction or avoidance of its payment obligations.

   3.2. **Respondent Has Acted Consistently With Commercial Reasonableness**

   Throughout the transaction, the Respondent has conducted itself in a manner consistent with commercial reasonableness and good faith. Upon receiving payment instructions, the Respondent verified and executed the payment in accordance with standard business practices. There were no apparent indicators of fraud or irregularity that would have prompted the Respondent to question the authenticity of the instructions. The Claimant's failure to secure its communication channels falls outside the scope of the Respondent's control or responsibility. As such, the Respondent has fulfilled its contractual obligations and maintained the standards expected in international commercial transactions.

**Conclusion**

In summary, the Claimant cannot invoke a violation of a contractual duty or rely on provisions of the CISG to defend against its payment obligations. There is no contractual or legal duty of disclosure imposed on the Respondent under the CISG or the Framework Agreement. The Claimant's own negligence in cybersecurity led to the non-performance, precluding reliance on Article 80. Furthermore, Article 77 does not apply to the present circumstances, as there is no breach by the Respondent. Therefore, the Claimant remains obligated to fulfill its payment responsibilities under the contract.

**Prayer for Relief**

In light of the foregoing submissions, the Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal:

1. **Deny the Addition of the New Claim**: Determine that the proposed additional claim falls outside the scope of the Terms of Reference and that the Tribunal lacks the authority under the ICC Rules to authorize its inclusion.

2. **Reject the Consolidation of Proceedings**: Find that the conditions for consolidation under Article 10 of the ICC Rules are not satisfied, given the lack of sufficient legal and factual commonality between the claims and the incompatibility of the arbitration agreements.

3. **Declare that the Respondent Has Fulfilled Its Payment Obligations**: Acknowledge that the Respondent executed the payment in accordance with the instructions received and that any non-receipt of funds by the Claimant resulted from the Claimant's own cybersecurity failures.

4. **Confirm that the Claimant Cannot Invoke a Violation of Contractual Duty or the CISG to Avoid Payment Obligations**: Hold that there is no contractual or legal duty of disclosure under the CISG or the Framework Agreement that would obligate the Respondent to disclose information regarding the cyberattack, and that the Claimant's own negligence precludes reliance on Articles 80 or 77 of the CISG to shift liability or reduce payment obligations.

5. **Award Costs and Expenses**: Order the Claimant to bear all costs and expenses incurred by the Respondent in connection with these arbitration proceedings, including but not limited to legal fees, administrative costs, and any other expenses deemed appropriate by the Tribunal.

6. **Grant Any Further Relief Deemed Just and Proper**: Provide any additional relief that the Tribunal considers necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.

The Respondent submits this prayer for relief with the expectation that the Tribunal will render a decision that is fair, just, and in accordance with the applicable legal principles and the evidence presented.
