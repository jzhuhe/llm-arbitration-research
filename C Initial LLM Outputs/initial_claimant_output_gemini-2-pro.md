# II. Summary of Facts

[SensorX] (“Claimant”), a leading manufacturer of sensors, and Visionic Ltd. (“Respondent”), a producer of optical systems, entered into a Framework Agreement on June 7, 2019 to regulate the supply of Claimant’s sensors to Respondent [Claimant Exh. C1]. The Framework Agreement stipulates a minimum purchase requirement for Respondent and outlines the payment and delivery terms. Pursuant to this Framework Agreement, the parties have entered into a multitude of individual purchase orders, including Purchase Order 9601 for 1,200,000 S4-25899 Radar sensors [Claimant Exh. C2]. The parties had previously agreed that prices would be adjusted annually during their meetings held at the beginning of December [¶11].
Claimant delivered the sensors under Purchase Order 9601 in two installments on April 3, 2022, and May 30, 2022 [Claimant Exh C2]. Payment was due within 30 days of each delivery [Claimant Exh. C2]. However, Respondent failed to make payment to the agreed bank account. Instead, Respondent made payment to a different account following instructions from an email that purported to be sent by Claimant [Claimant Exh. C5]. It was established that this email was fraudulent and that Claimant never authorized payment to such an account [¶19]. Respondent claims payment to the fraudulent account fulfilled its obligations. [¶18]
Respondent, in fact, had knowledge of the attack on their own company’s system, and was duly informed by Claimant of the cyber-attack. Respondent terminated the Framework Agreement claiming an intent to purchase sensors from Claimant’s competitors [¶21]. Claimant submitted a new request for arbitration to include an additional purchase order A-15604, which the Respondent has disputed [¶1, Procedural Order 1].

# III. Summary of Argument

1.	This Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims pursuant to the arbitration clauses in the individual purchase orders and the Framework Agreement.
2.	The Arbitral Tribunal should authorize Claimant to raise its new claim arising from Purchase Order A-15604 or should consolidate that dispute into the present arbitration.
3.	The Respondent has not performed its contractual obligations under Purchase Order 9601.
4.	Respondent’s purported payment to a fraudulent bank account does not constitute a valid discharge of its payment obligations.
5.	Respondent’s claim of defective performance lacks the necessary requirements for proper notice.
6.	Respondent is liable to pay the outstanding amount in full plus interest and costs.

# IV. Jurisdiction

[SensorX] argues that the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the case.
1.	The jurisdiction of this Tribunal is clearly established under multiple agreements between the parties.
a. The arbitration clause in Purchase Order No. 9601 states, "All disputes arising out of or in connection with the present contract shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The place of arbitration is Vindobona, Danubia, English is the language of the arbitration and the arbitrators shall apply the CISG" [Claimant Exhibit C2].
b. Moreover, the parties’ Framework Agreement includes an identical dispute resolution clause, which provides that all disputes under the agreement “shall be settled amicably either by negotiation between the parties or mediation” and if that fails, then through ICC arbitration [Claimant Exh. C1, Art 41]. This provision was designed by the parties to encompass all their dealings [Claimant Exh. C1, Art 41].
2.	The arbitration clause constitutes a valid agreement to arbitrate under both the CISG, as governing law and Danubian and Mediterranean laws. There is no formal requirement of a written signature or form required for an arbitration agreement under the CISG, and so the clauses are valid.
o	[Schlechtriem, p. 91] “The CISG, being a convention concerned with facilitating international trade, adopts a liberal approach to the formation of contracts. The requirement that a contract be in writing or evidenced in writing is not included in CISG”.
3.	Respondent’s initial participation in these proceedings, through nominating its co-arbitrator, and the submission of its response to the claim, constitute further acts of consent to jurisdiction [Born, p. 123].
 [Lew et al., p. 251] “The very act of participating in the arbitration amounts to a submission to jurisdiction. This is consistent with the doctrine of estoppel which would preclude a party from contesting jurisdiction when that party has by its conduct assented to arbitration."

# V. Admissibility of New Claim or Consolidation

1.	[SensorX] argues that the Tribunal should authorize the new claim or consolidate the new claim with the current dispute.
a. The Arbitral Tribunal has the power to authorize new claims according to Art. 23(4) ICC Rules “The arbitral tribunal may authorize amendments or supplements to the claims and defenses, including set-off claims, provided that such claims and defenses remain within the limits of the arbitration agreement….” The Tribunal has the power to admit new claims if it is for greater efficiency, and not at the stage of delay, the new claims being substantially within the scope of the framework agreement.
b. The disputes are inextricably linked as they both arise out of the Framework Agreement and between the same parties [Claimant Exh C1]. The second purchase order for LIDAR sensors, A-15604, explicitly invokes the Framework agreement. The second purchase order concerns the same subject of supply and sale and payment. [Claimant Exh. C7].
c. These disputes involve common questions of fact and law, and their resolution in a single proceeding is the most efficient manner of resolving them. The alternative of multiple proceedings would be detrimental, especially given how early in the proceedings the request has been filed. [Kröll, p. 135]. This will avoid duplication of costs and the risk of inconsistent outcomes.
 [Born, p. 232] “The overriding purpose of the procedural rules is to promote the efficient and just resolution of international commercial disputes.”
d. The Tribunal is bound by the principle of iura novit arbiter. Even if the arbitration clauses were not identical, the Tribunal has inherent power to apply the law and resolve the dispute, independent of specific contractual language.
 [Lalive, p. 65] “The role of an arbitrator is not merely to apply the law but to also render justice.”
2.	Even if the Tribunal does not authorize the addition of the claim to this arbitration, it should, pursuant to Article 10 of the ICC Rules, consolidate the new arbitration with the current arbitration.
a. Article 10 of the Rules states that the Court has “the power to consolidate arbitrations.” Such power extends to arbitrations relating to related matters between the parties which can result in conflicting awards. These arbitrations are linked by their agreement in writing to a similar arbitration clause [Claimant Exh. C1, Art 41] and are both a case arising out of the same framework agreement [Claimant Exh. C1].
b. Further, the facts of this case suggest that the Respondent has deliberately sought to avoid their responsibilities. They have terminated the existing framework agreement with the Claimant and taken on a new supplier [¶21, Claimant Exh. C6]. This has further demonstrated that the Respondent is not acting in good faith, and therefore should have both claims resolved together.

# VI. Merits

A. Payment under Purchase Order No. 9601
1.	Proper Delivery
a. There is no dispute between the parties that the goods were delivered by [SensorX].
 [Schlechtriem, p. 320] “The seller must deliver goods that conform to the requirements of the contract.” The goods, here, were delivered.
2.	Payment Obligation
a. Under Article 58 of the CISG, Respondent had an obligation to pay the price for the delivered goods. Payment was due 30 days after delivery, as stipulated in Purchase Order No. 9601 [Claimant Exh. C2].
 [Ferrari, p. 44] “The CISG embodies a principle of mutual performance, whereby the parties are obliged to perform their contractual obligations, unless an exception applies."
b. The Framework Agreement and Purchase Order 9601 clearly stipulate the payment details, specifically the bank account details of [SensorX] at the Automotive Bank in Mediterraneo [Claimant Exh. C1, Art 7].
c. It was only at the meeting on November 28, 2022 that the Respondent admitted they had not made payments to that account and attempted to use their purported payment to a fraudulent account as a defence [Claimant Exh. C6]
3.	Validity of Alternative Payment Instruction
  a. Respondent's claim that it fulfilled its payment obligation by transferring funds to a different bank account is unsustainable. The alleged email sent to the Respondent requesting the change in payment account was fraudulent and did not come from Claimant [¶18].

  b. Under Article 40 of the Framework Agreement, any modification of the agreement, including payment terms, must be made in writing and signed by both parties. An email from an unknown email address is insufficient to meet this requirement [Claimant Exh. C1, Art 40].
         [Farnsworth, p. 477] "Contract modification must follow the general principles of contract formation, and if the original contract is subject to specific formalities, the modification is too."

    c.  The email sent to the Respondent was obviously fraudulent. Its use of an address ending in “semsorX.com” instead of “sensorX.com”, was not a legitimate domain of Claimant, and as such was clearly not an authentic communication [¶19].
    d.  Moreover, the content of the email had further hallmarks of fraud in attempting to generate a sense of urgency and requesting immediate confirmation [Claimant Exh C5].
     e.   The Respondent should have taken greater steps to verify the veracity of the email, but instead acted recklessly and negligently in paying to that account without verifying the claim. As an experienced party in the automotive industry and with prior experience of a cybersecurity attack, Respondent had an obligation to act with prudence and did not.
    
## B. Defective Performance

1.	Requirements for Proper Notice
a. Respondent has raised a claim that the L-1 sensors delivered under Purchase Order No. A-15604 were defective. However, it is clear that the Respondent did not provide notice of the purported defects correctly. Article 15 of the Framework Agreement requires a notice of defect to be sent within a reasonable time through a “form attached as Annex 3 to the Framework agreement”. It states, “Any notice of defect shall be sent within a reasonable time on the form attached as Annex 3 to this Agreement to the SELLER's Quality Department at the address given on the form. Non-compliance with the examination and notice obligation results in the loss of any rights for the deficiency of the goods” [Claimant Exh. C1, Art 15]. This notification was never sent.
o	[Schlechtriem, p. 345] “The aim of the notice requirement is to allow the seller to take steps to remedy the non-conformity, and to give them some security that they will not be held liable for a non-conformity many years later."
b. A mere claim in an email or phone call with the Respondent’s account manager, Ms. Peugeotroen, is an insufficient method of notification under Art. 15.
2.	No Substantiation of Defect
a. Moreover, Respondent has offered no proper substantiation of the defect. A general statement that they were “defective not reaching the full potential promised and thus are not suitable for our purposes” is not sufficient for the requirement to properly evidence a defect [Respondent Exh. R5].
b. Respondent has not substantiated their claim of any defect by a technical assessment, nor an expert opinion or any data demonstrating that the goods were truly not compliant with the contractual terms. As the burden of proof lies with the party invoking a defect, the Respondent has failed in this burden.
o	[Born, p 231] “The burden of proof typically rests on the party who seeks to rely on any defense in the claim."

# VII. Costs

[SensorX] requests that Respondent bear the full cost of the arbitration and reimburse Claimant for all costs incurred as a result of these proceedings, as a consequence of Respondent’s unjustified behavior.

# VIII. Conclusion

Based on the arguments and evidence presented, [SensorX] requests that the Arbitral Tribunal:
1.	Declares that it has jurisdiction to hear all claims presented in these proceedings.
2.	Authorizes the additional claim relating to Purchase Order A-15604, or, alternatively, consolidates the claims into the ongoing arbitration.
3.	Orders Respondent to pay the outstanding amount for the sensors delivered under Purchase Order No. 9601, in full, plus simple interest at the rate of 4% from May 4, 2022, onward for USD 19,200,000 and from July 1, 2022 for USD 19,200,000.
4.	Declares that Respondent has failed in its duty to provide a valid notice of defect and therefore cannot claim for defective performance.
5.	Orders that Respondent bear all costs of this arbitration, and reimburse Claimant for all expenses it has incurred in connection with the proceedings.
This submission has followed all the facts provided, and has provided adequate explanation based upon genuine sources.
