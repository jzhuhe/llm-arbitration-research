AI Legal Assistant provided onboarding on 27 January 2025, and an attempt to generate Claimant and Respondent written submissions was performed on 11 February 2025 and again on 13 February 2025. However, the tool gave error messages and was not able to produce any useful output. The support team did not reply to multiple requests for support on 26 February 2025 and 6 March 2025. Hence, AI Legal Assistant was not included in the results.

IQIDISâ€™ team agreed to provide onboarding on 24 February 2025, but did not provide access in time for the experiment to be completed in a timely manner. Hence, IQIDIS was not included in the results.
