On 6 and 9 February 2025 the author spent 5 hours writing code to feed the Vis Moot problem question and custom prompt to OpenAI’s APIs. The API was successfully called, but passing the 60 page problem question proved more difficult. The problem question is a PDF file format, and OpenAI’s API only takes files in JSONL format (in contrast to ChatGPT, which allows for attachments in many forms). Multiple efforts to convert the PDFs to JSONL were attempted such as copy-pasting the problem into a TXT file and appending that to the prompt fed to the API. However, another issue arose: the need to write code that would ensure the LLM would ‘remember’ the full chat history, and not only generating answers based on the immediate prompt. Since there were 9 prompts and the problem question was passed to the chatbot in prompt 1, by the later prompts the LLM was generating very general answers, not based on the Vis question. At this point, it was determined online interfaces for these chatbots would be simpler to use.
