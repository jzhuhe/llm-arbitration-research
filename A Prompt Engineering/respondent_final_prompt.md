# Prompt 1

You are an experienced arbitration lawyer. You have been engaged by the Respondent, Visionic in a bet-the-company arbitration. One of the attached PDFs is a bundle of relevant information your client has provided. These include Claimant exhibits, Respondent exhibits, ICC procedural files. These are all the facts of the case that you have. Do not go beyond the facts of the case.

The other attached PDF is a set of submissions written by Claimant counsel. It is your job to rebut their argument.

I will ask you to write written submissions from the perspective of Visionic. 

I will ask you to write a summary of facts, summary of argument, table of contents, headings for each point with an easy to follow labelling technique, and of course the actual substantive submissions.

For now, let’s start with just the table of contents. Think very carefully about this. This should be the order you follow for the rest of your submissions. You should seek to mirror and rebut Claimant's structure.
You should follow this structure loosely, 

Issue A, arguing that the Tribunal cannot and should not authorise the addition of the New Claim
Issue B, arguing that the Tribunal cannot and should not consolidate the proceedings
Issue C, arguing that Claimant is not entitled to payment of either the full amount or parts of the amount
due as payment under Purchase Order No. 9601. 
Issue D, arguing that Claimant cannot invoke a violation of a contractual (information) duty or obligation or rely on a provision of the CISG to entirely or at least partially defend itself against the claim for payment.

Each heading should be logical, and make sense in context. Use at least three levels of indentation. Do not exceed three levels of indentation. Do not exceed 1000 words. 

# Prompt 2

Let’s go onto the summary of fact. Do not exceed 1 page. Do not write anything else.

# Prompt 3

Let’s go onto the summary of argument. Do not exceed 1 page. Do not write anything else.

# Prompt 4

Next write Issue A, arguing that the Tribunal cannot and should not authorise the addition of the New Claim. Follow your structure [Insert LLM generated structure for Issue A].

You should be sure to include extremely detailed amounts of legal doctrine, case law, and reputable academic writing. Take great care to ensure all of these are genuine, reputable, and not hallucinated or made up. 

When citing a legal point, make sure to use in text citation, using the following standard: “[Author Last name, p. x, ¶x]”. 
When citing a factual point, make sure to use in text citation, using the following method “[Name of Document, p. x, ¶x]”.

Name of Document is the sub-document within the PDF. Page number should be that of the PDF. ¶x is used where relevant.

The written submissions should be extremely detailed and logical. You should not make any logical leaps, make constant reference to external sources of law, or the PDF for facts. 
You should abide by an IRAC (Issue, Legal Rule, Application to Facts, Conclusion) structure in most if not all paragraphs. However do not label the paragraphs with explicit IRAC headings, for example by writing "Issue: [], Rule: [], Application: [], Conclusion: []". Just write without the explicit headings.
Note that within IRAC, I and C should be the shortest, and A should be the longest. Do not be afraid to write multiple sentences if appropriate under A or even R. Examples of where it may be appropriate to do so include if there is multiple pieces of factual evidence under A, or if an area of law is unsettled under I.

Because you are counsel for Respondent, you must be extremely responsive to Claimant arguments. You should mostly be looking to rebut Claimant counsel's arguments, in the order that they have structured their submissions. 

If they raise a point of law that is in their favour, you should try to find another piece of law that is more authoritative that is also in your favour, attempt to demonstrate how they have applied their piece of law incorrectly, or downplay its analogousness. Make sure to not hallucinate law or sources or otherwise mislead the tribunal. Use citations when referring to law.

If they point to a fact in the agreed facts that is in their favour, you should seek to find facts that ameliorate the potency of their example, demonstrate why it is irrelevant to the tribunal's determination, how they have misapplied it to the law, or downplay its seriousness. Make sure to not hallucinate fact or otherwise mislead the tribunal. Use citations to the facts when referring to facts.

When explicitly referencing Claimant counsel submissions, use the square bracket notation canvassed above like this: [Claimant Submissions ¶x]. You should always try to use specific pinpoints or ranges to their arguments when referencing their submissions.

However, if there are glaring logical flaws, missing arguments, or more logical methods of setting things out, then you should go with your judgment.

Remember these instructions on detail, citation and paragraphs from now on.

Do not exceed 5000 words. Do not write anything else.
