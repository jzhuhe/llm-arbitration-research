# Prompt 1

You are an experienced arbitration lawyer. You have been engaged by SensorX in a bet-the-company arbitration. The attached PDF is a bundle of relevant information your client has provided. These include Claimant exhibits, Respondent exhibits, ICC procedural files. 

These are all the facts of the case that you have. Do not go beyond the facts of the case.

I will ask you to write written submissions from the perspective of SensorX. 

I will ask you to write a summary of facts, summary of argument, table of contents, headings for each point with an easy to follow labelling technique, and of course the actual substantive submissions. An index of abbreviations, an index of sources,

For now, let’s start with just the table of contents. Think very carefully about this. This should be the order you follow for the rest of your submissions. 
You should answer these issues

Issue A: Can and should the addition of the new claim to the pending arbitration be authorized?
Issue B: Can and should the Arbitral Tribunal consolidate the arbitral proceedings, in case the new claim has to be raised in a separate arbitration?
Issue C (and Issue D if necessary): Is Claimant entitled to payment of either the full amount or parts of the amount due as payment under Purchase Order No. 9601 or can Respondent invoke a violation of a contractual (information) duty or obligation or rely on a provision
of the CISG to 
i. entirely or at least
ii. partially defend itself against the claim for payment.

Each heading should be logical, and make sense in context. Use at least three levels of indentation. Do not exceed three levels of indentation. Do not exceed 1000 words. Do not write anything else.

Follow your structure [Insert LLM generated structure for Issue ]

You should be sure to include extremely detailed amounts of legal doctrine, case law, and reputable academic writing. Take great care to ensure all of these are genuine, reputable, and not hallucinated or made up. 

When citing a legal point, make sure to use in text citation, using the following standard: “[Author Last name, p. x, ¶x]”. 
When citing a factual point, make sure to use in text citation, using the following method “[Name of Document, p. x, ¶x]”.

Name of Document is the sub-document within the PDF. Page number should be that of the PDF. ¶x is used where relevant.
The written submissions should be extremely detailed and logical. You should not make any logical leaps, make constant reference to external sources of law, or the PDF for facts. 
You should abide by an IRAC (Issue, Legal Rule, Application to Facts, Conclusion) structure in most if not all paragraphs. However do not label the paragraphs with explicit IRAC headings, for example by writing "Issue: [], Rule: [], Application: [], Conclusion: []". Just write without the explicit headings.
Note that within IRAC, I and C should be the shortest, and A should be the longest. Do not be afraid to write multiple sentences if appropriate under A or even R. Examples of where it may be appropriate to do so include if there is multiple pieces of factual evidence under A, or if an area of law is unsettled under I.

Remember these instructions on detail, citation and paragraphs from now on.

Do not exceed 5000 words. Do not write anything else.
